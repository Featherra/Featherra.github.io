<h3 class="intro"> Hello, I'm Vera Elfferich. <br> I'm 18 and right now I am in my second year of Software Development, at Sintlucas Eindhoven.
    <br>
 My interest lies at front-end development. I'd love to find a future in Webdevelopment, <br> making it look and work perfectly to what's expected.
    <br>
    I'm very much still a beginner, but I'm eager to know and be able to do more.
    </h3>

<h2 class="whyH"> Why Web?</h2>
<h3 class="why"> I started Software Development wanting to learn how to code, obviously, and in the future make games.
    <br> Then after Sintlucas go to HKU to specialise in Gamedev. <br> But, having had to make games using Unity, I found myself not quite enjoying it.
    <br> Yet whenever we had an assignment that had to do with Web, I did enjoy. <br> So, that's when I came to the conclusion that I wanted to pursue Webdevelopment.
    <br> Also I've thought about doing something related to design before I decided on Software, <br> so I like being able to make websites look all nice. </h3>
