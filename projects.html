I decided on parralex scrolling, having used CSS to make the effect work. First I had the idea to make it into an about me page but it didn’t go through. So, now you can just scroll through the sky. </h4>

After following the lessons, you had to make your own tilemap for the game, and use new ‘items’ that weren’t used during the explanation to really make it your own. </h4>
