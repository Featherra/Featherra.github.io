    <h2> What I can do</h2>
</div>

    <h2 class="skill html"> HTML </h2>

<div class="htmlT">
    <h3> I can create webpages using HTML, making them clear to navigate through.</h3>
</div>

    <h2 class="skill css"> CSS </h2>

<div class="cssT">
    <h3> I style the webpages using CSS, (till now) based off of what I think would look good. <br> Making sure the colours match and that the website is still readable.
        <br>I'm still working on getting the hang of flex and css grid. </h3>
</div>

    <h2 class="skill js"> Javascript </h2>

<div class="jsT">
     <h3> I don't know all that much about Javascript, till now I've worked with it to make a fortune teller with randomized sentences, we (me and my group) used switchcases for that.
            <br> Along with my point and click adventure game I've used Js to create the inventory, and to make it interactive.<br> Not to forget the cool mouse tracking effect that you see on every page here.</h3>
</div>

    <h2 class="skill ai"> AI </h2>

<div class="aiT">
     <h3> I was allowed to only use AI to create a frogger game (found at my projects page). <br> Quite the experience i'd say, although it worked out in the end (I might've changed and added some things myself, don't tell my teachers)
         <br> Besides that I have also used AI to help me with my projects whenever I was stuck with tutorials,
            <br> not too much though because we all know how good our dear friend AI is at helping us with our code. </h3>
</div>

    <h2 class="skill figma"> Figma </h2>

<div class="figmaT">
     <h3> I've created some little web designs using figma, before starting on the websites. <br> Although I would adjust some little things while coding to make it look better on the page, and update the design.
            <br> Too I've made an interactive festival app in Figma.</h3>
